This is a second collection of Warped Topographies following the publication of the original book in July 2018 by Kozu Books.

This new book presents two images which date back to the origins of the project, but most have been made in the last two years since the publication of the book. Iâ€™ve continued making images on a regular basis, sometimes beginning with abstract imagery, sometimes using portraits of people and politicians. More often than not I have added new elements including ink, and chemicals such as copper sulphate.
