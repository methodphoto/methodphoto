After some necessary tidying of my studio, I have found some extra seconds of **Warped Topographies II**. So if you missed out, or would like a copy for Sunday best, there are copies for you.

They are classed as seconds as they have a faint blue printing scuff in the margin area of one page ([see images here](warped-topographies-ii)), otherwise the reproduction is superb. As it will make more space in the office. 

[Warped Topographies II](#wt) is available for £6.50 + Shipping (UK or ROW). 

There are also a few copies of **The Prismatic Pond** still remaining. This book looks at the beauty in a small, overlooked, edgeland pond in a North London Country Park. A pond that for a few years captivated me with its beguiling show of colours, pattern and texture. 

[The Prismatic Pond](#pp) is in a signed, limited edition of 100, for £15.00  + Shipping (UK or ROW).

**If you would like both books for a combo price and one shipping fee then they are [available for £20.00](#buy-both-books) + Shipping (UK or EU/ROW).**

Copies ready for immediate dispatch
