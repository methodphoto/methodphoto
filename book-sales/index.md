I have a number of photobooks for sale, these are ones I no longer need or have duplicates of.

## Dark Room 
### Garry Fabian Miller

One copy of Garry Fabian Miller's Dark Room in excellent condition. 

An artistâ€™s memoir of a life lived making pictures between the dark and the light, a deeply personal account woven against the history of photography from the moment of its birth in the 1830s to its decline, and some would say death, in the digital age almost two hundred years later.
