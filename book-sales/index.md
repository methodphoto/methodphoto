I have a number of photobooks for sale, these are ones I no longer need or have duplicates of.

<div class="book-sales">

	<div class="book-sale-item-two">
		<p>A copy of Garry Fabian Miller's Dark Room in excellent condition.</p>

		<p>An artist’s memoir of a life lived making pictures between the dark and the light, a deeply personal account woven against the history of photography from the moment of its birth in the 1830s to its decline, and some would say death, in the digital age almost two hundred years later.</p>

	</div>
	<div class="book-sale-item-two">
		<p>Olaf Otto Becker (* 1959) presents us with idyllic dreamlike places, paradisiacal tableaus from the jungles of Malaysia and Indonesia. Roman­tic floodplains, tree trunks slung with liana vines, eco­logical niches for countless life forms―these are the kinds of untouched tropical rainforests that we pic­ture in our dreams. </p>

	<h3>Four Winters<br/>
	<em>Jem Southam</em></h3>
<div class="book-sales-container">

	</div>
	<div class="book-sale-item-two">
		<p>For the past four winters the English artist Jem Southam has repeatedly visited a short stretch of riverbank along the floodplain of the River Exe. He stands and watches, as the dusk fades into darkness or as the light of dawn gathers, witnessing the different passage of each winter. In the evenings, long past sunset, swans, geese and ducks arrive on the river to spend the night in safety. In the mornings the birds wake, preen, feed and socialise as they prepare for the new day.</p>
