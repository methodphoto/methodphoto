<p>Inside the Outside is a collective run by <a href="http://www.al-brydon.com/">Al Brydon</a>, <a href="http://www.robhudsonlandscape.net/">Rob Hudson</a>, <a href="http://www.stephensegasby.com/">Stephen Segasby</a> and <a href="http://www.josephwright.co.uk/">Joseph Wright</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Whether we simply enjoy being in the landscape or are involved in its representation the question we will all confront at some stage is ’How do we relate to the landscape?’. There is the inescapable awareness that we are of nature and yet apart from it. And although we can see and even imagine nature, it is beyond our abilities to fully comprehend it. Plus we all become aware that the land is not only changed by the hand of people, it can also change us.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Being in the landscape (and representing the landscape) is to simultaneously inhabit two worlds, the one before us and the one inside us. And when those two worlds collide and intermingle the result can often surprise.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>When John Muir wrote “I only went out for a walk and finally concluded to stay out till sundown, for going out, I found, was really going in.” (John of the Mountains: The Unpublished Journals of John Muir.) he expressed a key element of that two way transformative potential.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Taking inspiration for their name from Muir’s words the Inside the Outside collective are a diverse group of photographers that share an awareness of that potential and for whom it has become an essential element of their work. It is a question they commonly explore, but in highly individual and personal representations of the land around them.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Dealing as it does with the reality of what is before us, and also with the often unspoken ability to express something of our inner selves, photography is the perfect medium to explore our relationship with the land. And it also the perfect medium to mediate between those two simultaneous worlds of being there experiencing and the revelations that occur when we open ourselves to the creative possibilities of that liminal space.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Our aim is to share ideas, derive greater insight and inspiration by working together, exhibit our work collectively and to run associated events, talks and workshops.”</p>
