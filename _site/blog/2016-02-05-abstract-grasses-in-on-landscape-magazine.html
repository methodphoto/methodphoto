<p>Last week’s On Landscape Magazine published some of my <a href="../abstract-grasses">Abstract Grasses</a> in its <a href="https://www.onlandscape.co.uk/2016/01/subscribers-4x4-portfolios-106/">Subscribers 4x4 section</a>.</p>

<p>Their 4x4 feature is a set of four mini portfolios from their subscribers, each consisting of four images related in some way.</p>

<p>I also loved Stuart Westmore’s Roebuck Bay tides, abstract seascapes in the same section.</p>

<p>Aerial views such as these, and those shot by masters like <a href="http://www.hansstrand.se/">Hans Strand</a>, alter your perspective of the landscape more than almost any other part of the canon. Of course heading up in a plane is an expensive old business, but well worth it from the work we see.</p>
