<p>2020 may not have been the year to have exhibitions and private views, but <a href="https://www.londonphotography.org.uk/">London Independent Photography’s</a> annual exhibition was replaced by the <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CIGUs1YnhsE/">LIP Chronicles</a> which was a website, Instagram feed and a newspaper reflecting on life in lockdown</p>

<p>One of my abstract images was featured, <em>Summer Shimmer, Water Ripple</em>, which was made on one of my many summer walks, while permitted.</p>
