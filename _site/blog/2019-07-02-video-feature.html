<p>Life is zipping past quickly at the moment, so I completely forgot to link to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZbgUwId99yQ">Greg Whitton’s Quickshotz video</a> which contains a feature on The Prismatic Pond, my recent and current series looking at a small grotty pond in a local country park.</p>

<p>This may seem an unpromising concept for a series, but take a look for yourself. The piece about the project is at about 21:20 in, but why not watch the whole video!</p>
