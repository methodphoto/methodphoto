### {{page.year}}

It isn't often that I get to shoot images when the weather is -3C, with 20s winds, in the middle of a snowstorm, while the sun still shines, but I'm mightily glad I did with this set.

They were all shot on a frozen lake in Rif in the Snaefelsness peninsular of Iceland.

I'd noticed the lake the night before but  the light was too flat, but could see the potential of the shapes, colours and what it would look like in the right light. Despite the prevailing weather conditions, the next morning provided that light.

The title reflects my thinking that the shapes and forms reminded me of Tolkein's Dead Marshes from the Lord of the Rings (a book I detest - possibly the worst summer holiday ever was spent reading it!).

There are also elements of Jupiter's cloud patterns to be seen in the shapes; so being lost, far away with the possibilities lurking below, all helped inform this work.
