## Derek Cottrell

Derek originally became interested in photography in his late teens. His interest in
photography somewhat waned and for forty odd years it became just a means to record
high days and holidays. In the last seven years he has reconnected with photography. He
has had no formal training as such and he finds himself drawn to photography that can be
felt rather than be technically perfect.
