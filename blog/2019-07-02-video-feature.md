Life is zipping past quickly at the moment, so I completely forgot to link to [Greg Whittonâ€™s Quickshotz video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZbgUwId99yQ) which contains a feature on The Prismatic Pond, my recent and current series looking at a small grotty pond in a local country park.

This may seem an unpromising concept for a series, but take a look for yourself. The piece about the project is at about 21:20 in, but why not watch the whole video!
