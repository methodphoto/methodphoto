### it began with a riot of colour…

My project [The Prismatic Pond](../the-prismatic-pond) is the second book published my [Method Photo Press](https://methodphotopress.co.uk).

A 4 year study of a seemingly unremarkable pond, where the combination of light, organic decay and repeated visits led to a body of work which dazzles.

Copies are [directly available](https://methodphotopress.co.uk) and are £17:50 + shipping.
