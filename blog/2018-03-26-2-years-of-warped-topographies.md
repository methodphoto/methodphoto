Today (March 26th) marks the second anniversary of my first Warped Topographies post on Instagram, a series that has become something of an obsession ever since. It was a project that Iâ€™d begun about a month before and I decided to use Instagram as a diary and post it all.

But three years before that this Polaroid was the genesis of the project. I had been playing with a Polaroid camera and this image popped out. It was faulty, but I really liked it. Every so often it would reappear on my messy desk and Iâ€™d smile at it, thinking failures can be beautiful too. But it wasnâ€™t until February 2016 that it all clicked.

If you would like a print, then visit my store. Three framed prints will be part on the [#Connected 2018](http://www.connected-exhibition.co.uk/connected2018-launch-event) exhibition in April, so if youâ€™re in the Nottingham area come along to that!

Thank you to everyone who has liked, encouraged, shared and bought this series, you are all wonderful ðŸ˜„
