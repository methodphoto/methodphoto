From the RPS website:

> "Members worldwide were invited to submit their images to an open call competition, which was reviewed by a selection panel. The selected work celebrates the diversity of imagery being created by our community of members, at all levels of photographic practice.

> The exhibition tours the UK from March and also includes work from some of The Society’s Honorary Fellows, which has provided the selected photographers the rare opportunity to exhibit their work alongside some of the most respected names in photography today."
