On Landscape has kindly featured an article about my [Warped Topographies](https://www.onlandscape.co.uk/2017/04/warped-topographies/) project. It is available to paid subscribers only and I would urge you to subscribe regardless as it is a great independent publication featuring the full gamut of landscape, from close to wide, from blurry to detailed!
