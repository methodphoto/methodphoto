I am thrilled to announce that [Kozu Books](https://www.kozubooks.com/books-new/richard-earney-warped-topographies) will be publishing my book Warped Topographies in July 2018.

Kozu Books are well known for their high quality small format Landscape Editions. This will be a bit different as befits the rich textures of this series.
