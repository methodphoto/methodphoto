# Hive Motion

## General

 - Motion should be insightful, intuitive and sophisticated
 - Motion should have confidence, purpose and snap
 - It should create a simple moment of delight
 - Consider the overall page impact of lots of animations on a page
 
 ## Intros
 
  - Default - No Intro
  - Optional Photographic intro for Hive+
  
 ## Outros
 
  - Primary option = Wordmark + Know Your Power
  - Secondary option = Logo + Know Your Power (example = Hive+ videos where a Hive+ outro has been used)
  - Hive + Know Your Power should always be on the liquorice background

 ## Typography
 
 ### Basic
 
 1. Push up/down
 2. Subtile zoom reveal
 3. Instant text
 4. Word by word/sentence by sentence slide
 
 ### Special styles
 
 1. Word by word reveal (Potentially only for voice over)
 2. Letters and numbers roll
 
 ### Know Your Power style
 
 1. Subtle Zoom reveal
 
 - Typography in/outs should be limited to these styles to create a consistency
 - In order to retrain a refined feel and avoid busyness, styles should be limited to 1-2 per video for content 45 seconds and under, and 1-3 styles for videos over 45 seconds. 
 - Know Your Power text style is always the same. If the KYP text appears on the same screen as other text, the other text should utilise one of the other styles so there is a contrast between the content and the tagline.

## Informative (illustration and infographics)

 - Illustrations should be engaging and informative, with cause and effect where relevant
‘does it help the user focus or understand the info?
 - These should create a simple moment of delight that helps to inform the user
 
## Emotive illustration

 - Content should move naturally and follow real-life movements
 - Content should not break reality
 - Less is more - we want these to feel subtle and sophistacted
 - These should create a simple moment of delight
